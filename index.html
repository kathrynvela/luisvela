  <div id="about">
  <p>I have a lifelong interest in helping people manage their health. While I went into my biology undergraduate program with the intention of pursuing a career in medicine, my interests eventually led me to public health. I was intrigued by the focus on prevention, rather than treatment, when it came to creating health communitites. Interest in data analysis to monitor disease trends within communities. Enjoy the challenge of working in a dynamic and changing field.</p>

      <h3 class="box-header">Immunizations Quality Improvement</h3>
      <p>Many schools in Kootenai County struggle with maintaining accurate vaccination records. I collaborated with school officials and parents to complete student records and update Idaho's Immunication Reminder Information System (IRIS). By the end of this project, I achieved an 83.5% decrease in incomplete immunization records at a local elementary schoo This experience allowed me to develop my skills in data analysis and outreach with community members.</p>

    <div class="box" id="proj-2">
      <h3 class="box-header">Lung Cancer Prevention</h3>
      <p>I partnered with the Panhandle Health District's Tobacco Prevention Team to conduct four convenience & vape store assessments that were located close to schools. I also participated in the PHD 3-Call Program, which connects county residents with smoking cessation services and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT); I conducted outreach at local health events and encouraged community members to sign up for the program, then contact participants to discuss quitting nicotine products and provided strategies to help with the process.</p>

    <div class="box" id="proj-3">
      <h3 class="box-header">Flu Surveillance Project</h3>
      <p> I collaborated with the PHD epidemiology team to assist in the collection, entry, analysis, and information dissemination of flu data. I was responsible for preparing weekly reports for sentinel sites and PHD stakeholders.</p>

    <div class="box" id="proj-4">
      <h3 class="box-header">Motivations of Rural Healthcare Providers</h3>
      <p> My thesis project explored the factors behind physicians' decisions to practice in a rural area. I surveyed physicians licensed in the state of Washington who practiced in counties that had been designated rural by the Department of Health. The results showed that past experience in rural areas during childhood and residency had an impact on where physicians chose to practice medicine.</p>
